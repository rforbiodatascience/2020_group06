## Introduction
### The dataset
<br>
Our project has used a modified version of this data, which is available from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset>, by _Sudalai Rajkumar_, which consists of:

* patient data from the first 2 months of the outbreak 
* time-series data about the spread of the virus

Please note that infection spreading information and data regarding COVID19 is being updated every day. The data used for this project was first pulled on 15 April 2020, and has been updated accordingly since then. 

*__The last update of the data was done on 13 May 2020.__*
